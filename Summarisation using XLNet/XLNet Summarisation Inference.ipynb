In 2009, the South Korean government adopted measures to limit the number of hours students spent in \"hagwons\" or tutorial centres in a bid to reduce childhood stress and increase the level of creative thinking. But the impact has been limited, pushing many tutorial classes online. The government has since realised that the only way to change is to alter the exam culture, reducing the number of university entrance exams and encouraging universities to consider applicants on more than just exam scores. A Singaporean study showed that while tutoring can have a positive influence on the subject being tutored, time taken away from other subjects may lead to a decline in overall academic performance. The ADB report says in all parts of Asia, families are spending a considerable amount of the household income on tutoring. It may contribute to improved achievement for individual students, but it can exacerbate social inequalities.

The study of Shetland ponies found horses responded to the irritants in midge bites but their immune systems acted in two different ways. Some had itching while others were able to prevent an allergic reaction. Those that did not react were somehow able to block different immune cells that would otherwise trigger symptoms. Edinburgh University scientists hope this knowledge can be applied to humans, so that the immune system could be primed to respond in a way that does not set off a reaction, possibly preventing people developing allergies. Dr Dietmar Zaiss, of Edinburgh University's school of biological sciences, said: \"To our knowledge, this is the very first study of a natural allergic disease in which we can show that immune responses to allergens can take two directions, either leading to allergy or to tolerance. \"We believe this finding could have direct practical implications, for example by helping immune responses to choose the 'right' direction in individuals who we would like to protect from developing occupation-associated allergies.\"<sep>`\n",

Another set of test results this week gave a more optimistic view of England's teenagers. The OECD's league table of problem solving skills put England into a very respectable 11th place. This suggested that the school system is producing young people with enough rounded skills to be able to apply their knowledge. Such wider perspectives would have been impossible if the only yardstick was comparing this year's GCSE results with last year's. There are critics of such international rankings, who say that it's not meaningful or fair to compare such different countries. How can you measure an affluent Scandinavian country with a sprawling industrialised superpower or an emerging Asian city state? It might not be fair, but in a global economy young people from all those places will be competing with each other. And the outcomes are far from a foregone conclusion. Sweden has tumbled behind countries such as Poland and Estonia. But what difference does it make? As Mr Schleicher puts it: \"Your education today is your economy tomorrow.\"<sep>`\n",

An application to pull down the building and replace it with a new pub at ground level and residential units over several floors was refused by the council. Historic England - previously known as English Heritage - was recommending the 1920s building for listed status. Landlady Patsy Lord said she had no prior warning of the demolition and was only called out to move her son's car away from the building on the morning the bulldozers arrived. Historic England said the tavern was built in 1920 in the Vernacular Revival style by Frank J. Potter. It was commissioned by Charrington & Co brewery at a cost of AÂ£11,600 and replaced an earlier pub on the site dating from the 1860s that was destroyed by a German Zeppelin bomb on 19 May 1918.

Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US. However, the bankruptcy bid failed and a Boston court ruled that he could be held liable for debts of 10.5m euros (Â£8.34m). It was alleged during the bankruptcy case that the 48-year-old former bank boss secretly transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during bankruptcy proceedings. Authorities in the Republic of Ireland issued an extradition request last year and he was arrested at his American home in October. At a hearing in Boston last month, Mr Drumm agreed to return to the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible. Bailing out the bank cost Irish taxpayers about 30bn euros (Â£22bn: $34bn), close to one-fifth of annual output.
